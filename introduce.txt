I am a young and passionate individual who is 
looking for new challenges inthe remote job 
world. I was born and raised in Budapest but 
currently I'm living in the Netherlands. I would 
like to think of myself as being positive, 
energetic and someone who is works well with 
people and as well as under pressure. My programming skills consist of
HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Git! I'm in the process of
learning React, Angular, HTML5, and CSS3 and 
developing my knowledge of advanced Javascript. I am 
eager to learn new skills and gain more
experience in my career! Even though I take my 
work seriously, I like to have a laugh and have fun in the process.
